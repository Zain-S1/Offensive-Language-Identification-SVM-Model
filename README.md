# Offensive Language Identification SVM Model
Due to its side effects on the usersâ€™ mental, emotional, and health states, Offensive or Abusive Language is considered as the most damaging social media activity; which makes it a priority to limit its usage. This project aims to mitigate the spread of offensive language on the internet by developing a **robust Machine Learning Model**.

## Approach
A **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model** was developed and evaluated to effectively identify offensive language within text data. 
The model leverages the **N-gram** technique for feature extraction, transforming raw text into a numerical representation that highlights key linguistic features. 
This representation is then fed into a **Linear Support Vector Classifier**, which accurately distinguishes between offensive and non-offensive language.

## Dataset and Tools
* A **dataset** of 14,200 annotated English tweets, labeled as Offensive or Not-offensive
* **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to extract the most informative features
* **Pipeline library** to facilitate the sequential nature of the process of extracting features and classifying
* The **Linear Support Vector Classifier** to classify each tweet/text as offensive or not-offensive
